# Fuel Quota Management System

A comprehensive digital solution for managing fuel quotas during fuel crisis situations, consisting of a backend API, specialized web portals, and mobile application for fuel station operations.

## 🏗️ Project Overview

This system is designed to manage fuel crises for the general public by implementing controlled fuel quota distribution and monitoring. The platform addresses fuel shortage situations through systematic quota allocation, real-time transaction tracking, and automated notification systems for crisis management scenarios.

### System Highlights

**🚨 Crisis Management Platform**: Designed specifically for managing fuel shortages and crisis situations with controlled quota distribution

**🔗 DMT Database Integration**: Real-time vehicle validation through Department of Motor Traffic database connection ensuring authentic vehicle registration (In this project a mock dataset is used for validation.)

**📱 Dedicated Mobile Operations**: Android application exclusively for fuel station operators to scan QR codes and process fuel transactions

**🎯 Multi-Portal Architecture**: Three specialized web portals - vehicle owner registration, fuel station owner registration, and employee-only administration

**📊 Real-time Quota Monitoring**: Live tracking of fuel quotas and consumption during crisis periods with immediate balance updates

**📲 Mandatory SMS Notifications**: Automatic SMS alerts to vehicle owners after every fuel transaction via Twilio integration

**🔒 Secure QR Code System**: Unique QR code generation for each validated vehicle enabling quick identification and quota verification

### Key Features

- **Vehicle Registration Portal**: Online portal for vehicle owners to register by providing vehicle details with DMT database validation
- **DMT Database Validation**: Automatic verification of vehicle information through Department of Motor Traffic database (Mock database) connection
- **Unique QR Code Generation**: System generates unique QR codes for each validated vehicle registration
- **Fuel Station Registration Portal**: Dedicated online portal for fuel station owners to register their stations
- **Employee-Only Admin Portal**: Restricted web portal for administrators to monitor fuel distribution and manage station registrations
- **Android Mobile Application**: Specialized app for fuel station operators to scan QR codes and check available fuel quotas
- **Real-time Quota Verification**: Instant display of available fuel balance when QR codes are scanned
- **Fuel Transaction Processing**: Mobile app interface for operators to enter pumped fuel amounts after dispensing
- **Mandatory SMS Notifications**: Automatic SMS alerts sent to vehicle owners after each fuel transaction via Twilio
- **Crisis Management Dashboard**: Administrative tools for monitoring fuel distribution during crisis situations
